Key structure->
when the user enter the configure->

First Propmt the user for Master key ->user enter the master key
Then i will encrypt that master key and store that in keytar for checking
(but if the master key is already present there but then i again try to add new so it will cause an error) because it must be only set once
then when the email is written so then at that time i prompt to enter the master key again and encrypt that and the same process will be used for decryption but them mail issue is that i need to continuously enter the key for the Decryption 
it will be frustrating but what if for the first time when the user enter the master key and then i added them also in the Keytar and also in cache memory so that it master key will be fetched from the cache for the further processing but it is only for 1 day not continues
