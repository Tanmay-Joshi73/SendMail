Subject: You're My Coding Hero! 🦸‍♂️💻  

Hi Tanmay,  

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude for helping me excel in that coding round! Your expertise truly felt like having a human version of Stack Overflow 😄. When I found myself stuck on that algorithm, your advice turned me into a debugging ninja. I owe you at least three coffees (and perhaps a lifetime supply of memes) for saving me from certain doom (or just syntax errors).  

In all seriousness, your guidance was invaluable. Without you, I might still be caught in an infinite loop. I’m genuinely thankful for your support!  

Let’s get together soon to celebrate—pizza’s on me! 🍕  

Best,  
[Your Name]
